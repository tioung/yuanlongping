                <strong>袁隆平 (Yuan Longping)</strong> was born in Beijing, China on September 7, 1930. His ancestral home is in De'an County, Jiujiang, Jiangxi Province in Southern China.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>>Hybridizing rice</strong> to increase its yield had a problem: rice is a self-pollinating plant but hybridization requires separating male and female plants as parents, which was not feasible on a large scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1961 <strong>袁隆平</strong> spotted a seed-head of wild hybrid rice and by 1964, he hypothesized that naturally-mutated male-sterile rice could exist. Two years later he reported in a scientific publication that he had found a few individuals of male-sterile rice that could be used for the production of hybrid rice. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The first experimental hybrid rice did not show any significant advantage over commonly grown varieties, so <strong>袁隆平</strong> suggested crossbreeding cultivated rice varieties with ones growing wild in the countryside. In 1970, beside a railway line in Hainan, he and his team found a particularly important wild variety. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Using this one within a breeding programme resulted in varieties with yields improved by 20 - 30 % in the late 1970s, which in a country that always had to grapple with famine and starvation, was of no small significance. For this achievement, <strong>袁隆平 was dubbed the "Father of Hybrid Rice"</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Four asteroids and a college in China have been named after him. The minor planet 8117 Yuanlongping was also named after <strong>袁隆平</strong>. He also won the State Preeminent Science and Technology Award of China in 2000, the Wolf Prize in Agriculture and the World Food Prize in 2004.
            </p>
            <p>
                On May 22, 2021, <strong>袁隆平</strong> died of multiple organ failure at Xiangya Hospital of Central South University and a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBbGlNdCC7Y" id="tribute-link">nation wide mourning</a> rarely seen in recent years started.
